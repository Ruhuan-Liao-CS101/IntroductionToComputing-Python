# For fun

# One of your neighbors is a dentist who gives to each trick or treater 3 non-sugary treats such as:
# Pencil, apple, toothbrush, eraser, stickersâ€¦
# Get this multi-element treat from the user (in a comma separated input request ) 
# and store it in your above list as a sublist (-ie this element in your list is itself a list )
# Print your full list ( including sublist )
